Engineer Notes

checklist:
- An rpm SPEC file for each application
- A Makefile automating the build process
- A Virtual Machine template for testing the built packages
- Documentation on how you would:
  * Deliver the final packages to a client
  * Document a strategy for building update packages (e.g., how would you specify code versions, especially across repos)
  * What tools or methods you would lean on for remote support of these applications once installed

  Running the apps locally:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  sqlite3 database.db < schema.sql
  python app_a.py
  python app_b.py
  ```

  Making a request
  ```
  curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: mytoken' http://127.0.0.1:5000/jobs
  ```

  permissions list?  also needing sqllite, make sure the packages are downloaded via requirements.
