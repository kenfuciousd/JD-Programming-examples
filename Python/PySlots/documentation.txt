Requirements


I want to make a slot machine prototype, with the following features: 
	standard slot machine basics: 
		process: insert money, choose bets (1-3), spin button/lever, see presentation of win/loss, and get notified/rewarded if there is a win, cash out when ready. 
	I want behavior on a Jackpot win (flashing reel contents)
	I want to be able to receive, bet, win, and cash out credits without fail
		optionally for later: a user system to keep track of credits in a secure way
	The reels should be determined "at random" (bonus: do better than the random number generator in python, which ain't half bad)

	Customizations:
	I want it built in a way to be able to swap out the presentation: imaging/reels/sounds
	I want to be able to define winnig patterns: multilines, paytable

	long range goals:
	betting crypto?
	->	a good enough algorithm to be certified? 
	Player info, secured and usable (login, logout, transfer credits in, transfer credits out)


Specifications:

	Reel 
		composed of: 
			Lucky7_rainbow(1/500), 
			Lucky7 (7/500), 
			bar3(16/500), 
			bar2 (25/500), 
			bar1(30/500), 
			heart_rainbow(40/500), heart(40/500), clover(40/500), 
			bell (50/500), horseshoe (50/500),  
			cherries(67/500), lemon(67/500), melon(67/500)

		>> each value should be successively add up to 100% chance, corresponding to the paytable in frequency..
		- the current percentages are a reasonable approximation of good chances, coorelating to the following paytable:

	Rough Paytable outline for Generic Slot Title, per credit bet:
		Paytable			x1		x3 (only pays more for JP, otherwise just bet value)
		3 Rainbow 7s: 		500		10,000
		3 Red 7s:			100		300
		3 Bar3:				30  	90
		1 any 7:			25 		75
		3 bar2: 			20 		40
		3 bar1: 			10 		30
		2 any bar: 			5 		15
		3x heart, clover: 	4 		12
		3x of any metal		3 		9
		1 any bar,3x fruit:	2 		6
