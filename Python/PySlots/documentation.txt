Requirements


I want to make a slot machine prototype, with the following features: 
	standard slot machine basics: 
		process: insert money, choose bets, spin button/lever, see presentation of win/loss, and get notified/rewarded if there is a win. 
	Jackpot win and behavior (flashing reel contents)
	I want to be able to receive, bet, win, and cash out credits without fail
	The reels should be determined "at random" (bonus: do better than the random number generator in python; )

	Customization:
	I want it built in a way to be able to swap out the presentation: imaging/reels/sounds
	I want to be able to define winnig patterns: multilines, 







	long range goals:
	betting crypto?
	->	a good enough algorithm to be certified?
